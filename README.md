# 1 Hour React Traffic Light Challenge


This is a simple React application that simulates a traffic light system. It uses TypeScript for static typing and Vite for building and development server.

The main component is the TrafficLight component, which manages the state of the traffic light system. It cycles through the phases "go", "slow", "stop", and "ready" with different delays for each phase. The current phase is then passed to the SingleLight component, which displays the corresponding light.
